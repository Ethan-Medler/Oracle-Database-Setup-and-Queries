# Oracle-Database-Setup-and-Queries
Oracle Database Project


## General Info
This was the final project for my Oracle SQL Developer course with Salem University. In this project, I wrote code in sqldeveloper to set up and query a database for a fictional school system. I used SQL and PL/SQL to setup the schema, SQL to query tables, and PL/SQL to write some basic functions for the database.

## Technologies
